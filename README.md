## Featured Projects

### Token Optimization - Save 30-50% on AI API Costs

> **Problem**: AI API costs are destroying budgets.
> **Solution**: Drop-in client that automatically compresses prompts, caches responses, and optimizes context.

```python
from token_optimization import OptimizedAnthropic
client = OptimizedAnthropic()  # Same API, 30-50% cheaper
```

### DeadMan Intelligence Command - 5 AI Agents Working For You

> **Problem**: Manual research is tedious and expensive.
> **Solution**: 5 specialized agents gather intelligence in parallel while you sleep.

```bash
pip install deadman-intel
deadman-intel mission start --focus "AI developments"
```

**Agents**: Market Intelligence | Tech Surveillance | Policy Monitor | OSINT Analyst | Synthesis Engine

### Costco Warehouse Intelligence - FREE Database (643 Warehouses)

> **Problem**: Costco location APIs cost money or don't exist.
> **Solution**: Complete database with coordinates, hours, services, gas prices - totally free.

```python
from costco_intel import CostcoDatabase
db = CostcoDatabase()
nearby = db.find_nearest(lat=37.7749, lon=-122.4194, limit=5)
```

```
BUILD > BUY

If it costs money, I build a free alternative.
If it's closed source, I open it up.
If it's complicated, I simplify it.
